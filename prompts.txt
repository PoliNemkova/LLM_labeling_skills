Example 3

Post: The first episode is played. There will be others. And more. I will express a personal position. I cannot fail to mention this now. The Ukrainian state in its current configuration with a Nazi political regime will pose a constant, direct, and clear threat to Russia. Therefore, in addition to protecting our people and guarding the country's borders, the goal of our future actions, in my opinion, should be the full dismantling of the political regime in Ukraine.
Label: No

Note that the destruction of military objects (for example, an airbase) is not considered HRV.

You need to output label only."""
